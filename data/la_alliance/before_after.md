| Notes | The document is a report of approved claims rather than a traditional invoice with a single invoice date and total billed amount. The 'invoice_date' is extracted from the 'Data Disclaimer' statement 'accurate as of 3/26/2024', as there is no explicit 'Invoice Date' field. The 'billed_amount' is the sum of all 'Total Disbursed' amounts listed in the document. All claims were 'Approved' and 'Total Charge' matched 'Total Disbursed'. There were 42 entries for $210.34 and 15 entries for $239.42, summing to (42 * 210.34) + (15 * 239.42) = 8834.28 + 3591.30 = 12425.58. |

The 'Data Disclaimer' mentions 'accurate as of 3/26/2024', which appears to be a report generation date, not an invoice date. |
